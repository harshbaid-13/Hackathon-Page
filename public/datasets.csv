"Dr. Nisheeth Srivastava","BAP","At RSNA 2017 there was a contest to correctly identify the age of a child from an X-ray of their hand. This is the dataset on Kaggle making it easier to experiment with and do educational demos. Additionally maybe there are some new ideas for building smarter models for handling X-ray images.","nsrivast@iitk.ac.in","https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/rsna-bone-age"
